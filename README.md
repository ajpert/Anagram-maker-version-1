# Anagram-maker-version-1
Can reuse letters, needs to have a certain letter specified from user, and anagrams can be any length <br />

I made this code to "help me" on a word game: https://nytimes-spellingbee.com/ <br />
please run with c++ 11, you can use a different dictionary just replace the one given <br />
Enter the letters when prompted and the special character when prompted <br />
This is limited to the dictionary I found, and a good amount of the words are not accepted by the app
